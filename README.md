## [Project 1: Customer Analytics for Retail Company](https://github.com/shawn-y-sun/Customer_Analytics_Retail)

__Overview__<br>
This project aims to support a retail or FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) company to formulate suitable marketing strategies that could further maximize revenues on Candy Bars. To reach the fullest potential of bringing up revenues, a company should find the 'sweet spot' on the relationship between price and quantity. 

Conducting analysis on price elasicity would support us to find the optimal point. We will look at price elasticities of three aspects: purchase proability, brand choice probability, and purchase quantity. By doing this, we can construct strategies to increase the likelihood of a customer purchasing our products on all shopping stages. 

To better position our products, we will firstly perform segmentation on our customers to support our analysis on price elasiticity, allowing us to customize marketing strategies for customers with different backrgounds.

## [Project 2: Credit Risk Modeling for Loan Defaults](https://github.com/shawn-y-sun/Credit_Risk_Model_LoanDefaults)

__Overview__<br>
This project aims to measure the credit risk of a lending institution (i.e. a commerical bank) by calculating the expected loss of the outstanding loans. Credit risk is the likelihood that a borrower would not repay their loan to the lender. By measuring the risk effectively, a lender could minimize its credit losses while it reaches the fullest potential to maximize revenues on loan borrowing. It is also crucial for banks to abide by regulations that require them to conduct their business with sufficent capital adequacy, which, if in low, will risk the stability of the economic system.

The key metric of credit risk is Expected Loss (EL), calculated by multiplying the results across three models: PD (Probability of Default), LGD (Loss Given Default), and EAD (Exposure at Default). The project includes all three models to help reach the final goal of credit risk measurement.
